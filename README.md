# thuglib
Roguelike library in C#

This is very much still in development and not yet ready for widespread use.

Things we have planned:

* VT100/ANSI terminal support
* 256-color and 24-bit color terminal support
* Map display and UI objects
* Procedural map generation
* Pathfinding, line-of-sight and cover functionality
* Something something items NPCs etc.

## Usage

Well it's not all that usable right now, but there are some demos.  There's a Makefile too.  Type 'make' and some programs
will pop up.  Expect real documentation later.
